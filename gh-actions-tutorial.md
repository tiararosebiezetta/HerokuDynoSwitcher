## Running Heroku Dyno Switcher script in Github Actions

In this section, I will tell you the steps to make this script running in Github Actions. This method is more preferred by me as I don't need to make a new separated heroku account for deploying this script.

1. Fork this repo (use desktop mode if you use mobile phone)
2. Go to your repo's settings and open "Secrets"
3. Add the variables as I have stated <a href="https://github.com/tiararosebiezetta/HerokuDynoSwitcher/tree/actions-tutorial#-variables">here</a> into secret variables
4. Done, the script has been configured properly. 

The script has been scheduled to run at 00.00 UTC in 1st and 15th of a month.
